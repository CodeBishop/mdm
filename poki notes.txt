Overall Design
    The program should assess each drive and provide it's output as in-turn so that if the program hangs on a particular drive it will be obvious which drive killed it. Thus:
        for-each drive
            print mount point
            run smartctl
            print assessment
            
            
Items that need to be output for each drive:
    mount point
    manufacturer
    model (maybe)
    capacity
    SSD versus HDD
    Number of reallocated sectors (highlighted in red if greater than 0).
    Every "attribute" entry that has a non-dash in its WHEN_FAIL column.
    Number of hours (highlighted in yellow if greater than 10k)
